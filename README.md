# Sentiment Analysis Using NLP for Top Headlines

This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment analysis on global news headlines. The goal is to gather historical news data from different sources, perform sentiment analysis on the articles, and analyze trends over time. The project focuses on analyzing how certain news topics (such as Finance and Business) are covered in the media and how their sentiments evolve over time.

## Features
- Collects news articles from multiple sources such as GDELT, NewsAPI, and more.
- Performs sentiment analysis on the articles to classify them as positive, negative, or neutral.
- Provides visualizations to understand sentiment trends over time and the correlation between different topics.

## Project Components
1. **Data Collection**:
    - The project collects data from multiple sources including the [GDELT API](https://blog.gdeltproject.org/), NewsAPI, and others.
    - The collected data is filtered by different tones (positive, negative, or neutral) and stored for analysis.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**:
    - Each article is analyzed for sentiment using NLP techniques.
    - Tone-based sentiment scores are assigned to each article.
3. **Data Visualization**:
    - Correlation analysis is conducted between different topics (e.g., Business and Finance) to visualize any potential relationships between them.
    - Visualizations of sentiment trends over time are generated to help understand the evolution of sentiments.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Requests
- GDELT API
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for Data Visualization)

## Setup Instructions
